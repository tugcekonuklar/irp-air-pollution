    "# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\n",
    "\n",
    "An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information flows through networks of interconnected nodes, or neurons, each processing input and passing their output to the next layer. These networks are capable of learning complex patterns using algorithms that adjust connections between neurons based on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs consist of input, hidden, and output layers. The hidden layers can perform nonlinear transformations on the inputs, allowing ANNs to model complex relationships. They're applied in various fields like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparatively, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is specialized for processing sequences, capturing temporal dependencies by using loops within the network. However, standard RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies due to issues like vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of RNN designed to overcome this limitation. They include mechanisms called gates that regulate the flow of information and allow the network to retain or discard data over long sequences, making them more effective for tasks like time series analysis and language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are another specialized kind of ANN designed for grid-like data, such as images. CNNs employ filters to perform convolution operations that capture spatial hierarchies and features, making them powerful for image and video recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type of network—ANN, RNN, LSTM, and CNN—serves different purposes and excels in different applications, from the general pattern recognition of ANNs to the nuanced temporal or spatial data handling in RNNs, LSTMs, and CNNs, respectively."
